	// UserJWT sets the callback handler that will fetch a user's JWT.

	NoCallbacksAfterClientClose bool

	// LameDuckModeHandler sets the callback to invoke when the server notifies

	// If a ReconnectHandler is set, it will be invoked on the first
	// successful reconnect attempt (if the initial connect fails),
	// and if a ClosedHandler is set, it will be invoked if
	// it fails to connect (after exhausting the MaxReconnect attempts).
